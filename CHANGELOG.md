# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-08-10

First packaged release. The toolchain existed as a personal `~/.claude` config;
this is the half of it that is general, extracted so it installs anywhere.

### Added

- 25 skills and 7 agents, namespaced under `crewforge:`. No skill was renamed —
  the plugin name is already the prefix.
- `rules/` — the recon ladder, verification discipline, git hygiene and the
  subagent delivery contract, as plugin-owned files. Installed by
  `/crewforge:sprint-init`, by symlink, only when asked. Nothing is ever written
  to your `CLAUDE.md`.
- `scripts/budget_check.sh` — release gate on always-loaded context. The bundle
  measures ~1,124 tokens against a 1,200 budget.
- `scripts/name_check.sh` — every shipped skill and agent is invocable under the
  name its path implies.
- `scripts/sprint_init.sh` — report / install / uninstall for the rule files,
  with a contradiction check that refuses to install over a conflicting rule.
- `hooks/crewforge-root.sh` — publishes the install path once per session as
  `$CREWFORGE_ROOT`, because `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is not visible to the Bash
  tool.

### Changed

- All `~/.claude` and `/Users/...` coupling removed from shipped skills, agents
  and hooks — 42 files at the start, none at the end.
- `ledger.sh` writes to `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/crewforge/ledger`
  rather than assuming a `~/.claude` exists; `ceiling.sh` resolves its targets
  from the tree it ships in.
- `agents/architect-review.md` → `architect-reviewer.md`, matching the name its
  frontmatter always declared.
- Tests that were anchored to the originating repo's git history now skip
  outside it, rather than failing; `recon_config.bats` skips when no
  machine-local `team-sprint.config.yaml` exists.

### Not shipped

- `graphify` — needs a `uv`-installed binary. Held for a post-1.0 optional
  add-on.
- Six fallback agents (`api-security-audit`, `github-actions-expert`,
  `golang-pro`, `python-mcp-expert`, `python-pro`, `typescript-pro`) — they cost
  ~249 tokens, which would put the bundle at ~1,373 against a 1,200 budget.
  Revisit only if something else is hidden to pay for them.
- No `ceilings.json` and no `team-sprint.config.yaml`: both are one machine's
  state. Generated on first use.

### Known gaps

- Not yet run end to end on a repo the author has never seen (plan P4.3).
- Ubuntu CI is unproven; `stat -f` fallbacks exist in the four shipped scripts
  but the bats files are unaudited (plan P4.1).
- `skill-validator` / `agent-validator` grade-A sweep across the whole bundle is
  not yet a CI gate (plan P4.2).
